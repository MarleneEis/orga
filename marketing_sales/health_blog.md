In these times it is advisable to stay at home for reducing the risk of infection and minimizing the virus' spread, but everybody needs to go shopping from time to time. However, you never know if your store is overcrowded or even worse, if there is a queue in front of the store. To solve this problem, we from the SafeMarket team developed the idea to stay safe and simply check the actual store status and get your personal shopping time slot from home during the #wirvsvirus hackathon. 

SafeMarket is a digital reservation system for customers to book easily a time slot for grocery shopping. You can use the SafeMarket app or book a ticket via phone hotline. The supermarket capacity helps to make sure that is not overcrowded. This way, SafeMarket reduces the waiting queues in front of the stores. The result is that the stores would be used more evenly and the risk of the infection for customers and employees will be reduced, too. This improves the shopping experience as well as the healthy work environment due to less crowded markets and less waiting times. Also, the solution considers walk-in customers by giving the shop owner the choice, how many customers should be in the store and how many of them get a SafeMarket ticket.

For the first viable solution, our team implemented three parts during the hackathon: 
1. a flutter app for the customer to book a ticket
2. a vue.js app for the shop owner and doorman to maintain the store and check the tickets
3. a backend as web app in C#, to bring everything together 

During the hackathon, the target was to get a first solution running. But this point changed directly after the hackathon, when we merged with other market-related teams, that had similar ideas, to successfully join the “Solution Enabler” program supported by the German government. 

The focus we are working on right now is, to bring the SafeMarket solution live to the real markets. Therefore we are currently reaching out to supermarket chains. We also had to evaluate our artifacts and compare them with the core requirements. Our goal is to setup a scalable and easy to use solution. We started to move our backend to a serverless architecture that is auto scalable using a FaaS platform. Also, we continuously developed our customer app. It is already deployed in a first beta version in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safe_market.reservation_system_customer&hl=de)

Stay tuned!
